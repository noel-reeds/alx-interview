## Concepts Needed:  
1. 2D Arrays (Matrices):  
    Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.  
    Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).  

2. Conditional Logic:  
    Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.  

3. Counting Techniques:  
    Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.  

4. Problem-Solving Strategies:  
    Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.  

5. Python Programming:  
    Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.  
    Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
